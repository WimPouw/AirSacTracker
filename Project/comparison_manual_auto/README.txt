This folder contains the necessary codes and data to run the comparison between manually tracked circles and hough trackings for the same videos. 

Many parameter combinations were run for the hough transformation (details in manuscript). The five best tracking combinations were chosen manually by visual inspection of individual 
frames where the tracked circles had been drawn onto the frames (pictures of chosen parameter combinations are included in the folder "hough_trackings_for_comparison_to_manual). Fully tracked videos
with overlaid circles are also included in the folder.  

Comparison to manual trackings were calculated for the five parameter combinations seperatly, to see differences and find thr "best" options. 

Results for these five parameter combinations are stored as example 1-5, the parameter combinations for the 5 examples are as follows:

example 1: c1_5_c2_10_al_1_b_30_dil_5_blur_13
example 2: c1_5_c2_12_al_1_b_30_dil_7_blur_19
example 3: c1_5_c2_12_al_2_b_20_dil_7_blur_27
example 4: c1_5_c2_14_al_2_b_30_dil_5_blur_27
example 5: c1_7_c2_10_al_1_b_30_dil_7_blur_19
